1. Files

1. Suppose the command ls were unavailable. What command could you use to view files in the current directory instead? Explain why the command works?

- You can use the dir command, as it functions with the same functionality as the ls command. Alternatively, you can use echo as well.

2. What option do I need to supply to the rm command to ensure I am prompted before a file or directory is removed? What option do I need to supply to the rm command to ensure I am not prompted before a file or directory is removed? What happens if both options are used simultaneously - which one has precedence?

- you need to supply the -i option

3. What are some differences between the rename command and the mv command?

- mv moves or renames files and directories, alongside backing them up. rename will just rename files.

4. The file command, when run against an executable program shows ELF 64-bit LSB executable. What does ELF mean in this context?

- ELF stands for Executable and Linkable Format, which is a format used for storing binaries, libraries and core dumps.

5. Consider the empty file test.txt. Why does ls -l test.txt say the filesize is 0 but du test.txt says the file size is 1?

- The command shows it as -1, due to it looking at the inode number of the file. du test.txt shows the file size as 1, because it counts the number of blocks that the file uses.

2. Directories

1. Find a better way to do the following
	mkdir grandparent
	mkdir grandparent/parent
	mkdir grandparent/parent/child

- mkdir -p grandparent/parent/child

2. How do you create a directory with a space in it? How do you remove a directory with a space in it?

- creating: mkdir "directory with spaces"
- removing: rm -r "directory with spaces"

3. How do I create a directory and set it's permissions to dr-x------ using only the mkdir command?

- mkdir -m 300 directory

4. Suppose I was working in /dir1/dir2/dir3 and I cd to /dir4/dir5/dir6. What is an easy way to get back to /dir1/dir2/dir3 without using the explicit command cd /dir1/dir2/dir3 (perhaps I forgot what the full path name was).

- You can use cd -

5. Suppose I used pushd to add 10 folders to my stack. How do I quickly determine which folder is the 6th folder in my stack and how do I quickly cd to it?

- You can use cd $6

3. Permissions

1. What option(s) do I need to add to chmod to print out what modifications are being made?

- You can use the -v option

2. What option(s) do I need to add to chown to get file2 ownership to simply match file1?

- chown --reference=file1 file2

3. What option(s) do I need to add to the stat command to display file permission, user ownership, and group ownership only?

- stat -c "%A %U %G" filename

4. How do you grant a group permission to write data to a file, but prevent the users in that group from moving, removing, or renaming the file?

- chmod g+w filename

5. When using chmod in symbolic mode, what happens if u/g/o/a are omitted. Eg. chmod +x <filename>

- The corresponding permission will not be changed if u/g/o/a are omitted.
